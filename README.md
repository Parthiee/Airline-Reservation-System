# Airline-Reservation-System
The main objective of the Airline Booking System is to design and implement an efficient and flawless system which ultimately helps the employees of the airline system to issue reservation tickets for various air flights and maintain the records of various passengers and provide quick services to the passengers.
The main objective of the project includes:

● Higher productivity and effective management.
● Maintaining the records of the passengers
● Reservation and cancellation of the tickets at their own convenience place
● Details about the availability of seats in the flight
● Quick information regarding the ongoing offers and discounts (if any)
● To minimize the repetitive work done by the system administrator and reservation
clerks.

**Motivation for the Problem:**
The conventional method of ticket reservation involves physically traveling to the airport
and waiting in long queues. There are scenarios where people are not able to get
reservations due to their inability to stand in queues for long periods of time or the tickets
got sold out by the time they reached the airport. There are also cases of overbooking,
where the airline sells more tickets than the number of seats available, to avoid empty
seats by no show passengers. Additionally, there is a need to manually fill the paper
document and submit it to the respective authorities for booking the tickets. Working men
often spend most of their time working and barely have any time for themselves.
Traveling to the airport and waiting in queues for a ticket is difficult for them if there is
an urgent meeting in some other place. This system provides an easy interface to book or
cancel a ticket at any time at their convenience.
